A short, short time ago, in a place not very far away,
Some guy named Mike maybe? decided he wanted to go somewhere.
I'm thinking maybe Yellowstone, or Prague, or Nigeria.
He was looking into plane tickets and RV rentals,
when he suddenly had a wonderfully fantastic idea.
He would teleport! He needed to assemble a team to help
him realize this dream of his he'd had for a whole 2 seconds.
So he went to work assembling them and put together the
best scientific team in the history of the world.
But one of the scientists took it too far, and decided
to test the device himself, and didn't tell Mike.
Unfortunately Mike was examining the device at the time,
and the device went off with a large BANG!!
Now Mike finds himself in a world unknown to him,
and wonders what he'll do in his new reality...
