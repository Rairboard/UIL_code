Thirty
They rushed out the door, grabbing anything and everything they
could think of they might need. There was no time to double-check to make sure they
weren't leaving something important behind. Everything was thrown into the car and
they sped off. Thirty minutes later they were safe and that was
when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all.

sidelines
Terrance knew that sometimes it was simply best to stay out of it.
He kept repeating this to himself as he watched the scene unfold. He knew that nothing good would come of him getting involved.
It was far better for him to stay on the sidelines and observe. He kept yelling this to himself inside
his head as he walked over to the couple and punched the man in the face.

wouldn't
Ten more steps. If he could take ten more steps it would be over, but his legs wouldn't move.
He tried to will them to work, but they wouldn't listen to his brain.
Ten more steps and it would be over but it didn't appear he would be able to do it.

curiosity
There was a time when he would have embraced the
change that was coming. In his youth, he sought adventure
and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go
back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it
was useless. That curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe
anything that put him out of his comfort zone.

wrath
It's not his fault.
I know you're going to want to, but you can't blame him. He really has no idea how it happened.
I kept trying to come up with excuses I could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened,
but the more I tried, the more I could see none of them would work. He was going to get her
wrath and there was nothing I could say to prevent it.

routine
Dave found joy in the daily routine of life.
He awoke at the same time, ate the same breakfast and drove the
same commute. He worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at
6 pm sharp every night. It was who he had been for the last
ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change.

Peter
Peter always saw the world in
black and white. There were two choices for every
situation and you had to choose one of them. It was therefore terribly uncomfortable
for him to spend time with Ashley. She saw the world in shades of gray with hundreds of choices to choose from in every situation.

programmed
"It doesn't take much to
touch someone's heart," Daisy said with a smile on her face.
"It's often just the little things you do that can change a person's day for the better."
Daisy truly believed this to be the way the world worked, but she didn't understand that she was merely a
robot that had been programmed to believe this.

generator
She considered the birds to be her friends.
She'd put out food for them each morning and then she'd watch as they came to the feeders to gorge
themselves for the day. She wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her.
Would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning?
