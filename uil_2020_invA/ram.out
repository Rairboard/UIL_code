Lynyrd Skynyrd is an American rock band formed in Jacksonville, Florida,
in 1964. The group was originally named My Backyard and comprised Ronnie
Van Zant, lead vocalist, Gary Rossington guitar, Allen Collins, guitar,
Larry Junstrom, bass guitar, and Bob Burns, drums. The band spent five
years touring small venues under a variety of different names and with
several lineup changes before finally deciding on "Lynyrd Skynyrd" in 1969.
The band released their first album in 1973, having settled on a lineup
that included bassist Leon Wilkeson and former Strawberry Alarm Clock
guitarist Ed King. Burns would later be replaced by Artimus Pyle, and
King by Steve Gaines. At the height of their fame during the 1970s, the
band popularized the "Southern" rock genre with songs such as "Sweet
Home Alabama" and "Free Bird"
