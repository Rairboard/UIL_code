Mr. Michael Zimm
1234 Namovur Street
Asity, Texas 78923

This is a sample e-mail with 3 addresses in it. However, your program
will only pick up on a couple of them. For example, your program would
never be able to distinguish a line that had too many characters. In fact,
Dr. Michaels, you cannot be assured that you will find all addresses no
matter how much you try. Without the power of simple human intelligence,
I doubt if you will find even half of them.

Even this letter will throw you for a loop because only one of the following
is actually an address.

Ms. AlFalfa With forty one character name
8294 This is not an address
Wrong, Answer 12345

Dr Person
2 Bee missing period
in, Doctor 13523

 Mrs. Column 2
1 invalid address
Lubbock, Texas 79409

Mrs No State Name
1 Bad Address

Mr. Wright
37 Winnie Pooh Court
Calgary Alberta 15A325

Mr. Wright is the only correct answer. The
other three are not addresses because they
violate 1 or more rules

Sincerely,

Mrs. Ima Hogg
2 Wiggs Way
Garland, Texas 77049
